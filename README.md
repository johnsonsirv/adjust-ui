## CSS Grid Framework
In this project we created a custom grid-based CSS framework called Adjust UI.

It is a Sass framework that empowers you to create flexible, clear, and semantic website layouts. A modular, front end framework to easily and quickly help you jumpstart your process in building complex interfaces for the web right out the box. We adopted the 12-grid style in popular framewokrs like Bootstrap and Foundation, and included some commonly used components

##### This project only demontrates how to create a custom css framwork with full control on internal workings.

We then used the framework to clone a live website [Here](https://gridbyexample.com/).
This project was completed in line with requirements and standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
